### Go Concurrency

Go language has built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels.

- A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution that can be created with the "go" keyword. Goroutines run concurrently with other goroutines within the same program.

- Channels are a way to communicate between goroutines and synchronize their execution. A channel can be used to send and receive values between goroutines.

- This approach to concurrency allows for clear and efficient management of multiple tasks without the need for locks or other synchronization mechanisms.
